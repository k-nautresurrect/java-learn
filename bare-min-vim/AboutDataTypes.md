# Integer type
	- int is converted to Integer wrapper class type then equality is considered
	- every primitive class is converted to the wrapper class
	- Integer wrapper class object have some different properties while int does not inherit any method of Integer class.
		- to perform operation on any primitive data type we have to pass it by calling the class name and method name in that particular class.
		- eg: ``` Integer.floatValue(primitiveType)```
		- whereas in wrapper class ``` wrapperObj.methodName() ```
		- as the methods that can be applied on "Integer" wrapper class and "int" primitive class are different it is preferred to use primitive int instead of Integer wrapper class object.
	- Some common Question on int data type.
		- conversion from int to char, String, float, double.
		- reverse, absolute reverse, tokeninze
		- setting precisions.
